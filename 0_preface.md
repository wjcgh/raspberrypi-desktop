# Dedication

This book is dedicated to my parents, and my
teachers, Mr Folpiano, Mr Yohalem, Mr David,
Mr Roberts and Mrs Metviner,
all of whom saw something in me, and gave me
their attention when I needed them.

I would not be where I'm today without them.


# Preface

I'm writing this book to share my experiences on how
to optimally configure Raspberry Pi 4, 400 and 5, for
desktop use.

## N100 Mini PC - Use Linux Mint Edge for Intel AX101 Support
Why Raspberry Pi and not a N100 Mini PC for desktop use?

Glad you asked.

If you need to get some work done, a N100 Mini PC is a
great value and a great choice.

N100 is powerful enough for desktop work, and comes
pre-assembled with a case and a NVMe drive, and is bundled
with a power supply. It's for sale at $150 on Amazon
when it's on sale.

So all in all, N100 is the way to go if you need to get
a computer up and running quickly so you can get your
work done.

If you decide to go with a N100 Mini PC, I would like
to suggest you install the [Linux Mint Edge](https://linuxmint-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/edge.html)
Linux distribution for the most hassle free Linux
installation experience.

Many of the N100 Mini PC uses the Intel AX101 wifi,
which is not supported until a late version of Linux
kernel, 6.4.32+. Linux Mint Edge is based on Linux
kernel 6.5, so automatically support Intel AX101 wifi.

## Why Raspberry Pi?

Why am I recommending Rasbperry Pi when I think so
highly of N100?

Because they both works and Raspberry Pi has some
features that a N100 Mini PC does not have.
I'll list features that drives me to Raspberry Pi,
especially a Pi 5.

Pi OS is a Linux distribution. This is important
to me as I can get all of the open source software
I use without additional cost. Yes I recommend
installing Linux Mint Edge with N100 Mini PC too.
See the section above.

I'm not a Windows hater. I've used Windows since
Windows 2 circa 1980s, running on Intel
286 processor. However, Windows has been getting
bloated by the year and  Linux desktop has matured
sufficiently to have all of the desktop apps I
use. During the COVID lockdown, I tested Ubuntu
and Linux Mint and decided to jump in and switchedi
over to Linux Mint as my primary OS. I'm glad I
made the switch.

Why Linux Mint and not Ubuntu?

As a Windows user, I found the Cinammon GUI more
familiar than Ubuntu.

Even though N100 is a low power Intel processor,
it still consumes a lot more power than a Pi 5.
N100 idles at 7W, but a Pi 5 consumes 7W when it's
busy chugging away with work. For the desktop
work I do, a Pi 5 suffice, so why incur a higher
electricity cost with a N100 when I don't need
its power?

Pi OS comes bundled with Wolfram Mathematica,
a powerful Mathematics tool for students of all
ages. It's much more powerful than any calculator,
and most Mathematics software. I can do Algebra
such solving Algebraic equations, Differentiation,
and Integration. It's free instead costing 100s
of dollars. For a student or a hobbyist like me,
this is a wonderful gift.

For parents that asks me to recommend a first
computer for their children, Raspberry Pi is what
I recommend.

Raspberry Pi is powerful enought to be useful and yet not
powerful enough to run most graphics intensive video games,
or these video games aren't available for Raspberry Pi.

Access to video games is often a parental concern on when
to introduce computers to their children. Raspberry Pi
is a solution to assuage this concern of children using
their computers to play games instead of doing useful work
with them.

Lastly, since Raspberry Pi is based on the ARM processor,
it's not a popular platform for malware. This also lessen
worries parents have. I'll cover hardening Pi OS in the
software configuration and usage chapters of the book.

All in all, Raspberry Pi 4, 400 and 5 currently occupy the
sweet spot of the minimal desktop computer. In particular
as a student's desktop computer from grade school and up.
